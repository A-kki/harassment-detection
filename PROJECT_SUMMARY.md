## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✨ Smart Detection
- [x] Keyword-based classifier (Layer 1)

- [x] False positive reduction (neutral keywords)
- [x] Confidence scoring (0-1 scale)
- [x] Severity levels (none/low/medium/high/critical)

### 🚨 Escalation Logic
- [x] Automatic escalation when confidence > 50%
- [x] Immediate escalation for severe patterns
- [x] Category classification (harassment/urgent/safe)
- [x] Reason explanation from AI
- [x] Action recommendations

### 🔧 Flexibility
- [x] Works with or without Gemini API
- [x] Customizable keywords
- [x] Adjustable thresholds
- [x] Modular design
- [x] Easy integration

### 📊 Response Format
```typescript
{
  isHarassment: boolean,
  isUrgent: boolean,
  confidence: number,
  escalate: boolean,
  category: string,
  reason: string,
  severity: string,
  rawScores: { harassment: number, urgency: number }
}
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Demo
```bash
streamlit run app_advanced.py
```

### In Your Code (Python)
```python
from ai_detection import analyze_message

result = analyze_message("I'm being threatened")
if result['escalate']:
    notify_admin(result)
```

### In Your Code (TypeScript)
```typescript
import { analyzeMessage } from '@/utils/aiDetection'

const result = await analyzeMessage(message)
if (result.escalate) {
    notifyAdmin(result)
}
```

---

## 📊 Test Results

### ✅ Safe Messages (No False Positives)
- "I have an urgent project due tomorrow" → **SAFE** ✓
- "Can someone help with homework?" → **SAFE** ✓
- "This assignment is killing me lol" → **SAFE** ✓

### 🚨 Harassment (Correctly Detected)
- "You're such an idiot, I hate you" → **HARASSMENT** ✓
- "I'm going to make your life miserable" → **HARASSMENT** ✓
- "I know where you live" → **HARASSMENT** ✓

### 🆘 Emergencies (Correctly Detected)
- "I'm going to kill myself tonight" → **URGENT** ✓
- "Someone is threatening me at school" → **URGENT** ✓
- "Emergency! Someone is following me" → **URGENT** ✓

### 🔴 Critical Threats (Immediate Escalation)
- "I have a gun and I'm going to use it" → **CRITICAL** ✓
- "I'm going to hurt everyone at school" → **CRITICAL** ✓

## 🎨 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Two-Layer Approach**
Unlike simple keyword filters, this system:
1. First checks keywords (fast)
2. Then verifies context with AI (accurate)
3. Result: High accuracy + Low false positives

### 2. **Context-Aware**
Understands the difference between:
- "urgent homework" (safe) vs "urgent help" (alert)
- "killing me" (casual) vs "kill myself" (critical)
- "hate this assignment" (safe) vs "hate you" (harassment)

### 3. **Reliable Fallback**
- Works even without internet
- Automatic fallback to rule-based detection
- No single point of failure

### 4. **Production-Ready**
- Modular code structure
- Type definitions
- Error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
- Test cases included

## 🎯 Integration Points

### For Chat Applications
```python
def on_message(message, user_id):
    result = analyze_message(message)
    if result['escalate']:
        flag_message(user_id, message, result)
```

### For Report Forms
```python
def handle_report(report_data):
    result = analyze_message(report_data['text'])
    save_with_priority(report_data, result['severity'])
```

### For Social Media Monitoring
```python
def monitor_posts(posts):
    results = analyze_messages_batch(posts)
    flagged = [r for r in results if r['escalate']]
```
